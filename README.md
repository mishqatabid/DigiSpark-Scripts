# DigiSpark-Scripts
The Digispark is a tiny development board powered by the ATtiny85 microcontroller, known for its compact size, affordability, and USB interface. With limited I/O pins and flash memory, it is suitable for small-scale projects and offers compatibility with the Arduino IDE, making it accessible to hobbyists and makers.

This is a set of hand-written DigiSpark sketches for the Arduino IDE that utilize the DigiKeyboard.h library making the DigiSpark to act as a keyboard and execute a variety of actions.

# INSTRUCTIONS
- To deploy the payload, we will download the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)
- Open the IDE, create a new sketch file and write down the code for Digispark Attiny85.
- The script is then compiled and uploaded on Arduino present in Digispark Attiny85
